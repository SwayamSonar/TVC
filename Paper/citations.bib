  title     = {Satellite Dynamics and Control in a Quaternion Formulation (2nd edition)},
  abstract  = {This lecture note treats modelling and attitude control design using a quaternion description of attitude for a rigid body in space. Dynamics and kinematics of a satellite is formulated as a non-linear model from Euler{\textquoteright}s moment equations and a description of kinematics using the attitude quaternion to represent rotation. A general linearised model is derived such that the user can specify an arbitrary point of operation in angular velocity and wheel angular momentum, specifying the a inertia matrix for a rigid satellite. A set of Simulink{\textregistered} models that simulate the satellite{\textquoteright}s nonlinear behaviour are described and a Matlab{\textregistered} function is described that has been written to calculate the linear model in an arbitrary point of operation.},
