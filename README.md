# `scp_new_problem`

This is a template package that you can use to implement your own optimal
control problems, to be solved using the [SCP
Toolbox](https://github.com/dmalyuta/scp_traj_opt/tree/jgcd). For reference,
the package comes preloaded with a very simple Dubin's car trajectory
generation problem with obstacle avoidance. You can feel free to remove this
example for your own work.
